Safe Spec
______________
"Safer testing with RSpec"

RSpec allows you to stub a method that an object does not respond to. To alleviate this, safe spec provides you with 
convenient "safe" methods that enforce the object responds to the message before allowing a stub.

To use a "safe" method, just prepend "safe_" to the stubbing method.

object_instance.safe_stub(:method)
object_instance.safe_should_receive(:method)

INSTALL:

This has only been tested with RSpec 2. There is a high chance it will not work with the first version of RSpec.
This has also only been tested using RSpec's mocking framework. 

Add the gem to your Gemfile, and then in your spec_helper add:
require 'rspec_safe_spec_monkeypatch'
